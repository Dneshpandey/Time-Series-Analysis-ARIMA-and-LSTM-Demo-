# Time-Series-Analysis-ARIMA-and-LSTM-Demo
**Financial time series analysis using ARIMA Model (Autoregressive integrated moving average) and Univariate LSTM and Multivarieate LSTM (Deep Learning) - ASX

This article describes the various ways that is used or implemented. For a more complete explanation, see the report that is provided.

This project includes
1) ASX - 2015 -2018_orig
2) I've added two source files and a CSV files.

   *Preparation of data, pre-processing of data, ARIMA model, and LSTM (Univariate model) (Source code)

   *LSTM (multivariate model) feature addition (Source Code)

3) CSV file with future close return that shows the missing dataâ€™s (for observation).

4) Data count on each Ticker (for observation)
